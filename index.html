    <h1>Basics</h1>
    <h2>JavaScript Fundamentals</h2>
    <h3>What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h3>
    <p>var: Function-scoped and can be redeclared, leading to potential bugs.
        let: Block-scoped, ideal for variables that may change.
        const: Block-scoped, used for variables that shouldn’t be reassigned.</p>
    <h3>Explain the event loop in JavaScript.</h3>
    <p>The event loop ensures non-blocking execution in JavaScript by handling asynchronous operations. It moves completed tasks from the callback queue to the call stack when the stack is empty.</p>
    <h3>What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>== compares values after type conversion (loose equality).
        === compares values and types (strict equality).</p>
    <h3>What is a closure in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>A closure is a function that retains access to its outer lexical scope, even after the outer function has executed.</p>
    function outer() {
        let count = 0;
        return function inner() {
          count++;
          return count;
        };
      }
      const counter = outer();
      console.log(counter()); // 1
      console.log(counter()); // 2
      
      <h3>How does async/await improve asynchronous programming?</h3>
      <p>async/await makes asynchronous code easier to read and maintain by allowing you to write it in a synchronous style. It is built on top of Promises.</p>
    <h2>React Basics</h2>
    <h3>What are React hooks, and why are they used?</h3>
    <p>A:
        React hooks, like useState and useEffect, allow function components to manage state and side effects, making code more concise and reusable.</p>
        <h3>How does the virtual DOM work?</h3>
        <p>The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React updates the virtual DOM first, calculates the difference (diffing), and applies only the changes to the real DOM for better performance.</p>
    <h3>How do you manage state in a React application?</h3>
    <p>Component State: Using useState or useReducer for local state.
        Global State: Libraries like Redux, Context API, or Zustand</p>
        <h3>What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?</h3>
    <p>Controlled Component: The form input's value is controlled by React state.
        Uncontrolled Component: The DOM maintains the input's state, and refs are used to access its value.</p>
        
        <h2>Angular Basics</h2>
    <h3>What is two-way data binding in Angular?</h3>
    <p>Two-way data binding ensures synchronization between the model and the view. Changes in the UI automatically update the data and vice versa using the [(ngModel)] directive.</p>
    <h3>What are services in Angular?</h3>
    <p>Services are singleton objects that enable data sharing and logic reuse across components in Angular, typically implemented with dependency injection.</p>
<h3>What is dependency injection in Angular?</h3>
<p>Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern where Angular injects required dependencies (e.g., services) into components automatically, improving modularity and testing.</p>
<h2>How does Angular handle routing?</h2>
<p>Angular uses the RouterModule to configure routes. You define routes in the app-routing.module.ts file and navigate between them using routerLink or programmatically via the Router service.</p>
    <h2>Theoretical Questions</h2>
<h3>What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?</h3>
<p>A:

    Synchronous: Code is executed line-by-line, blocking further execution until the current task is finished.
    Asynchronous: Code executes independently, allowing non-blocking operations via callbacks, promises, or async/await.</p>
<h3>How do RESTful APIs work?</h3>
<p>RESTful APIs follow the principles of REST, using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD operations on resources identified by URLs.</p>
<h3>Explain the concept of REST in web development.</h3>
<p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources represented by URLs.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between client-side and server-side rendering?</h3>
<p>Client-side rendering (CSR): JavaScript renders content in the browser after downloading.
    Server-side rendering (SSR): The server generates the full HTML for a page and sends it to the browser, improving SEO and initial load times.</p>

<h2>Soft Skills and Approach</h2>
<h3>How do you approach learning a new technology?</h3>
<p>Start by understanding the core concepts through documentation or tutorials, build small projects to apply learning, and gradually scale to more complex tasks.</p>
<h3>Can you describe a challenging project you worked on and how you handled it?</h3>
<p>Refer to your experience at E-ship Simplified or Dreammill, highlighting how you tackled scalability or performance issues using React, Redux, or Node.js.</p>
<h2>Practical Angular/React Scenarios</h2>
<h3>How would you optimize a React app for performance?</h3>
<p>Use React.memo for component re-renders.
    Optimize state management by colocating state.
    Use lazy loading for routes and components.
    Implement code splitting with tools like Webpack.</p>
<h3>How would you implement error handling in an Angular application? </h3>
<p>Use interceptors for HTTP error handling.
    Provide user feedback with alerts or modals.
    Implement a global error handler using the ErrorHandler class.</p>
<h2>Debugging and Problem-Solving</h2>
<h3>How do you debug a complex issue in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>Reproduce the issue in isolation.
    Use debugging tools like Chrome DevTools.
    Log key variables to track data flow.
    If necessary, write unit tests to pinpoint the bug.</p>
<h3>If a React component isn’t rendering correctly, how would you troubleshoot?</h3>
<p>Check props and state for errors.
    Ensure parent components pass correct data.
    Validate lifecycle methods or hooks usage.
    Inspect for potential syntax or logic errors.</p>
<h3>How can you improve the performance of a web application?</h3>
<p>Minimize DOM manipulations.
    Use lazy loading for assets.
    Optimize images and static files.
    Avoid unnecessary re-renders in React using React.memo or useCallback.</p>
