    <h1>Basics</h1>

    <h2>JavaScript Fundamentals</h2>
    <h3>What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>var:</strong> Function-scoped and can be redeclared, leading to potential bugs.<br>
        <strong>let:</strong> Block-scoped, ideal for variables that may change.<br>
        <strong>const:</strong> Block-scoped, used for variables that shouldn’t be reassigned.
    </p>

    <h3>Explain the event loop in JavaScript.</h3>
    <p>The event loop ensures non-blocking execution in JavaScript by handling asynchronous operations. It moves completed tasks from the callback queue to the call stack when the stack is empty.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>==</strong> compares values after type conversion (loose equality).<br>
        <strong>===</strong> compares values and types (strict equality).
    </p>

    <h3>What is a closure in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>A closure is a function that retains access to its outer lexical scope, even after the outer function has executed.</p>
    <pre><code>function outer() {
    let count = 0;
    return function inner() {
        count++;
        return count;
    };
}
const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2</code></pre>

    <h3>How does async/await improve asynchronous programming?</h3>
    <p>async/await makes asynchronous code easier to read and maintain by allowing you to write it in a synchronous style. It is built on top of Promises.</p>

    <h2>React Basics</h2>
    <h3>What are React hooks, and why are they used?</h3>
    <p>
        React hooks, like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>, allow function components to manage state and side effects, making code more concise and reusable.
    </p>

    <h3>How does the virtual DOM work?</h3>
    <p>The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React updates the virtual DOM first, calculates the difference (diffing), and applies only the changes to the real DOM for better performance.</p>

    <h3>How do you manage state in a React application?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Component State:</strong> Using <code>useState</code> or <code>useReducer</code> for local state.<br>
        <strong>Global State:</strong> Libraries like Redux, Context API, or Zustand.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Controlled Component:</strong> The form input's value is controlled by React state.<br>
        <strong>Uncontrolled Component:</strong> The DOM maintains the input's state, and refs are used to access its value.
    </p>

    <h2>Angular Basics</h2>
    <h3>What is two-way data binding in Angular?</h3>
    <p>Two-way data binding ensures synchronization between the model and the view. Changes in the UI automatically update the data and vice versa using the <code>[(ngModel)]</code> directive.</p>

    <h3>What are services in Angular?</h3>
    <p>Services are singleton objects that enable data sharing and logic reuse across components in Angular, typically implemented with dependency injection.</p>

    <h3>What is dependency injection in Angular?</h3>
    <p>Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern where Angular injects required dependencies (e.g., services) into components automatically, improving modularity and testing.</p>

    <h3>How does Angular handle routing?</h3>
    <p>Angular uses the <code>RouterModule</code> to configure routes. You define routes in the <code>app-routing.module.ts</code> file and navigate between them using <code>routerLink</code> or programmatically via the Router service.</p>

    <h2>Theoretical Questions</h2>
    <h3>What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Synchronous:</strong> Code is executed line-by-line, blocking further execution until the current task is finished.<br>
        <strong>Asynchronous:</strong> Code executes independently, allowing non-blocking operations via callbacks, promises, or async/await.
    </p>

    <h3>How do RESTful APIs work?</h3>
    <p>RESTful APIs follow the principles of REST, using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD operations on resources identified by URLs.</p>

    <h3>Explain the concept of REST in web development.</h3>
    <p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources represented by URLs.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between client-side and server-side rendering?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Client-side rendering (CSR):</strong> JavaScript renders content in the browser after downloading.<br>
        <strong>Server-side rendering (SSR):</strong> The server generates the full HTML for a page and sends it to the browser, improving SEO and initial load times.
    </p>

    <h2>Soft Skills and Approach</h2>
    <h3>How do you approach learning a new technology?</h3>
    <p>Start by understanding the core concepts through documentation or tutorials, build small projects to apply learning, and gradually scale to more complex tasks.</p>

    <h3>Can you describe a challenging project you worked on and how you handled it?</h3>
    <p>Refer to your experience at E-ship Simplified or Dreammill, highlighting how you tackled scalability or performance issues using React, Redux, or Node.js.</p>

    <h2>Practical Angular/React Scenarios</h2>
    <h3>How would you optimize a React app for performance?</h3>
    <p>
        Use <code>React.memo</code> for component re-renders.<br>
        Optimize state management by colocating state.<br>
        Use lazy loading for routes and components.<br>
        Implement code splitting with tools like Webpack.
    </p>

    <h3>How would you implement error handling in an Angular application?</h3>
    <p>
        Use interceptors for HTTP error handling.<br>
        Provide user feedback with alerts or modals.<br>
        Implement a global error handler using the <code>ErrorHandler</code> class.
    </p>

    <h2>Debugging and Problem-Solving</h2>
    <h3>How do you debug a complex issue in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>
        Reproduce the issue in isolation.<br>
        Use debugging tools like Chrome DevTools.<br>
        Log key variables to track data flow.<br>
        If necessary, write unit tests to pinpoint the bug.
    </p>

    <h3>If a React component isn’t rendering correctly, how would you troubleshoot?</h3>
    <p>
        Check props and state for errors.<br>
        Ensure parent components pass correct data.<br>
        Validate lifecycle methods or hooks usage.<br>
        Inspect for potential syntax or logic errors.
    </p>

    <h3>How can you improve the performance of a web application?</h3>
    <p>
        Minimize DOM manipulations.<br>
        Use lazy loading for assets.<br>
        Optimize images and static files.<br>
        Avoid unnecessary re-renders in React using <code>React.memo</code> or <code>useCallback</code>.
